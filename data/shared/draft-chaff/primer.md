Draft Chaff is a shared-library battle box built for quick, interactive kitchen-table games with iconic cards and straightforward play patterns.

### Rules
Start with 4 cards, 5 basic lands, and 5 allied/enemy Guildgates in the command zone. 1 mulligan to 4 allowed.

Each turn, you may play 1 land from the command zone. Draw from the shared library and keep separate graveyards.

### Game Plan
Most games are about board development and efficient trades. The creature curve is low, and cheap interaction is dense, so early sequencing matters: deploy pressure, trade resources, then turn the corner with stronger 4+ mana plays.

Use card selection and small value effects to stay smooth through the midgame. Spells like [[Divination]], [[Remand]], [[Miscalculation]], and [[Think Twice]] reward careful timing, while creatures with built-in value such as [[Man-o'-War]], [[Resolute Reinforcements]], [[Skeleton Archer]], and [[Scrapwork Mutt]] help keep parity while advancing your board.

Top-end threats are meant to swing games when they stick. Cards like [[Serra Angel]], [[Mahamoti Djinn]], [[Sengir Vampire]], [[Shivan Dragon]], [[Colossal Dreadmaw]], and [[Triskelion]] can quickly end stalled games. Premium interaction such as [[Lightning Bolt]], [[Doom Blade]], [[Oblivion Ring]], [[Flametongue Kavu]], [[Reclamation Sage]], and [[Icy Manipulator]] is there to force decisions and keep those finishers contestable.

The intended feel is "high signal, low bookkeeping": most cards affect combat or the battlefield directly, and the strongest lines usually come from tempo, clean trades, and sequencing discipline rather than hard locks.
