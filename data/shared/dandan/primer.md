Dandân, a terribly weird format where you maneuver to get a quorum of fishes, then swallow your opponent in five bites. With 10 [[Dandân]] and 38 spells, most of the action occurs on the stack, as both players maneuver for advantage in landing and protecting their own fish for combat.

The shared library plays a big role. [[Memory Lapse]], [[Brainstorm]], [[Predict]], [[Mystical Tutor]], and [[Vision Charm]] let you manipulate the top of the library to sculpt your own draws or screw your opponent over. Each card can play double duty, so there's plenty of decision-making involved.

Blue is typically light on removal, but the quirks of [[Dandân]] warp the mechanics. [[Crystal Spray]] and [[Magical Hack]] become removal spells and [[Vision Charm]] boils the ocean.

A small red splash for [[Mystic Retrieval]] completes the strategic layer-cake. Put on your biggest thinking cap and cast away!
