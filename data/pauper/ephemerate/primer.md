Chain ETB effects to create soft-infinite loops. [[Ephemerate]] creates nonstop value with every creature in the deck, then you can muscle into a win with defensive interaction.

### Nonobvious Combos
[[Ephemerate]] + [[Archaeomancer]]
[[Ephemerate]] + [[Mulldrifter]] (Evoked)
[[Cleansing Wildfire]] + [[Rustvale Bridge]]

### Early game
Use cantrips and setup tools like [[Brainstorm]] and [[Lórien Revealed]] to hit land drops and find interaction. [[Cleansing Wildfire]] smooths the manabase by targeting your Bridges for an easy 2-for-1. Use removal like [[Galvanic Discharge]] and [[Abrade]] liberally.

### Midgame
Start looping ETB creatures. [[Mulldrifter]] and [[Fallaji Archaeologist]] provide cards and selection. [[Murmuring Mystic]] to stabilize. When you find [[Archaeomancer]], rebuy [[Ephemerate]] for the endgame value loop.

### Endgame
Win through attrition and air power. Repeated [[Mulldrifter]] triggers and [[Murmuring Mystic]] tokens eventually overwhelm opponents, or maybe they just give up after the fifth [[Archaeomancer]] drop.
