Ephemerate is a value‑control deck that chains ETB creatures and rebuy effects. [[Ephemerate]] plus [[Mulldrifter]] and [[Archaeomancer]] creates a steady stream of cards and recurring interaction, while [[Counterspell]] and efficient removal keep opponents from sticking threats.

### Early game
Use cantrips and setup tools like [[Brainstorm]] and [[Lórien Revealed]] to hit land drops and find interaction. [[Cleansing Wildfire]] smooths the manabase by targeting your Bridges and replaces itself. Aim to survive the early turns with removal such as [[Galvanic Discharge]] and [[Abrade]].

### Midgame
Start looping ETB creatures. [[Mulldrifter]] and [[Fallaji Archaeologist]] provide cards and selection. [[Murmuring Mystic]] is great for stabilizing against wide boards if your removal cannot keep up. If you find [[Archaeomancer]], you can rebuy [[Ephemerate]] for an inifnite loop and setup a soft lock with counterspells or removal.

### Endgame
Win through attrition and air power. Repeated [[Mulldrifter]] triggers and [[Murmuring Mystic]] tokenseventually overwhelm opponents, or maybe they just give up after the fifth [[Archaeomancer]] drop.
