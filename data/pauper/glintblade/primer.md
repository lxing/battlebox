Combine cheap ETB draw with bounce creatures to gain unlimited value. There's no killer finish, but emptying your opponent's board and hand is usually good enough for a win.

### Early game
Develop your board with [[Novice Inspector]] and [[Thraben Inspector]], then start looping them with [[Glint Hawk]] or [[Kor Skyfisher]]. [[Cast Down]] and [[Tithing Blade / Consuming Sepulcher]] help stabilize the board.

### Midgame
Carefully balance repeated value from bouncing your value pieces against tempo and board state. Beyond [[Tithing Blade|Tithing Blade / Consuming Sepulcher]], none of your ETB effects disrupt your opponent's board, so durdling too hard for card advantage may leave you open to getting killed by faster development. Use removal freely to counteract this.

### Endgame
If you've made it this far, your material advantage should be overwhelming. Chip away with impunity through flying damage while your opponent cries over an empty board and hand.
