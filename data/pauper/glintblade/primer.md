Glintblade is a BW midrange deck that leverages cheap artifact value and powerful bounce creatures to grind. [[Glint Hawk]] and [[Kor Skyfisher]] repeatedly pick up [[Lembas]] and [[Thraben Inspector]] to generate cards, while [[Novice Inspector]] and [[Thraben Inspector]] keep the artifacts flowing for your payoff creatures.

### Early game
Develop your board with cheap creatures and artifacts, then start looping them with [[Glint Hawk]] or [[Kor Skyfisher]]. [[Inspiring Overseer]] keeps the cards coming and provides evasive pressure, while [[Cast Down]] and [[Tithing Blade / Consuming Sepulcher]] help stabilize the board.

### Midgame
Grind value by reusing your artifact ETB effects. [[Refurbished Familiar]] adds a disruptive element and helps close games as you strip cards from the opponent’s hand. Your creature base supports steady chip damage while your removal keeps opposing threats in check.

### Endgame
Win by out‑valuing opponents and pushing incremental damage through the air. Once you’ve accumulated enough material, a sequence of flyers backed by removal finishes the game while the opponent struggles to keep up with your repeated card advantage.
