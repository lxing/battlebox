Glintblade is a BW midrange deck that leverages cheap artifact value and powerful bounce creatures to grind. [[Glint Hawk]] and [[Kor Skyfisher]] repeatedly pick up permanents, and every other permanent generates some kind of value on ETB.

### Early game
Develop your board with cheap creatures and artifacts, then start looping them with [[Glint Hawk]] or [[Kor Skyfisher]]. [[Cast Down]] and [[Tithing Blade / Consuming Sepulcher]] help stabilize the board.

### Midgame
Carefully balance repeated value from bouncing your value pieces against tempo and board state. Beyond [[Tithing Blade|Tithing Blade / Consuming Sepulcher]], nothing you play disrupts your opponent's board, so durdling too hard for card advantage may leave you open to getting killed by a bigger board. Use removal freely to counteract this.

### Endgame
If you've made it this far, your material advantage should be overwhelming. Chip away with impunity through flying damage while your opponent cries over an empty board and hand.
