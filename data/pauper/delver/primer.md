Delver is a mono-blue tempo deck that uses cheap cantrips to deploy oversized threats quickly. [[Delver|Delver of Secrets / Insectile Aberration]] provides early pressure, while [[Tolarian Terror]] and [[Cryptic Serpent]] become cheap once your graveyard is stocked with instants and sorceries. The plan is to land a threat, protect it, and keep opponents off balance.

Although a "tempo" deck, Delver is very aggressive and you should play as such. Use cantrips proactively to dig for big snakes and go for the kill. The deck is very light on removal and cannot trade efficiently even in the midgame.

### Early game
Lead with a [[Delver|Delver of Secrets / Insectile Aberration]] or a cantrip chain. [[Brainstorm]], [[Ponder]], [[Mental Note]], and [[Thought Scour]] sculpt your hand and fill the graveyard to enable early discounted creatures. [[Spell Pierce]] and [[Counterspell]] provide early interaction and can be held up with your instant speed cantrips.

### Midgame
Dig hard until you can land a [[Tolarian Terror]] or [[Cryptic Serpent]]. Continue to trade on the stack. [[Lórien Revealed]] and [[Deep Analysis]] keep the cards flowing so you can stay ahead on counters, while tempo plays like [[Deem Inferior]] buy time against big threats.

### Closing the game
Stick a serpent or insect, protect it, and end the game quickly.
