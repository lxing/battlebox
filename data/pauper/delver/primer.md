Chain cheap cantrips to deploy oversized threats quickly. [[Delver|Delver of Secrets / Insectile Aberration]] provides early pressure, while [[Tolarian Terror]] and [[Cryptic Serpent]] are effectively free once your graveyard is stocked with instants and sorceries.

Although a "tempo" deck, Delver is very aggressive and you should play as such. Use cantrips proactively to dig for big snakes and go for the kill. The deck is very light on removal and cannot trade efficiently even in the midgame.

### Early game
Lead with a [[Delver|Delver of Secrets / Insectile Aberration]] or a cantrip chain. Fire off as many [[Brainstorm]], [[Ponder]], [[Mental Note]], and [[Thought Scour]] as possible; don't be conservative here unless you suspect graveyard hate. [[Spell Pierce]] and [[Counterspell]] provide early interaction and can be held up with your instant speed cantrips.

### Midgame
Dig hard until you can land a [[Tolarian Terror]] or [[Cryptic Serpent]]. Continue to trade on the stack. [[Lórien Revealed]] and [[Deep Analysis]] give you solid card advantage and [[Deem Inferior]] is solid, if ephemeral removal.

### Endgame
Stick a serpent or insect, protect it with countermagic, and swing. The lategame is not your friend.
