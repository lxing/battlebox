Chain cheap cantrips to deploy oversized threats quickly. [[Delver|Delver of Secrets / Insectile Aberration]] provides early pressure, while [[Tolarian Terror]] and [[Cryptic Serpent]] are effectively free once your graveyard is stocked with instants and sorceries.

Although a "tempo" deck, Delver is very aggressive and you should play as such. Use cantrips proactively to dig for big snakes and go for the kill.

### Nonobvious Combos
[[Deem Inferior]] + [[Thought Scour]]

### Early game
Lead with a [[Delver|Delver of Secrets / Insectile Aberration]] or a cantrip chain. Fire off as many [[Brainstorm]], [[Ponder]], [[Mental Note]], and [[Thought Scour]] as possible; don't be conservative here unless you suspect graveyard hate. [[Spell Pierce]] and [[Counterspell]] provide early interaction and can be held up with your instant speed cantrips.

### Midgame
Dig hard until you can land a [[Tolarian Terror]] or [[Cryptic Serpent]]. Continue to trade on the stack. [[Lórien Revealed]] and [[Deep Analysis]] give you solid card advantage. [[Deem Inferior]] is ephemeral unless you mix it with [[Thought Scour]].

### Endgame
Stick a serpent or insect, protect it with countermagic, and swing. You are slightly disfavored in lategame against several decks.
