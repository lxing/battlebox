Ramp is a GR big‑mana deck that accelerates quickly with enchantment auras and then cascades into huge threats. [[Arbor Elf]], [[Utopia Sprawl]], and [[Wild Growth]] create explosive starts, while cascade creatures like [[Boarding Party]] and [[Annoyed Altisaur]] provide free spells and a steady stream of large bodies. Initiative and venture cards such as [[Avenging Hunter]] and [[Writhing Chrysalis]] give the deck a powerful midgame payoff.

### Early game
Focus on ramping: attach [[Utopia Sprawl]] or [[Wild Growth]] early and pair with [[Arbor Elf]] for up to 4 mana on turn 2. [[Malevolent Rumble]] does double duty on ramp and card selection and [[Eldrazi Repurposer]] is an incredibly annoying defensive piece. The goal is to jump from setup turns into a fast six‑drop.

### Midgame
Cascade chains take over. A resolved [[Boarding Party]] or [[Annoyed Altisaur]] swings the tempo heavily in your favor, and [[Avenging Hunter]] pressures hard with the initiative. Your creatures are large enough to dominate combat and force unfavorable trades.

### Endgame
Same plan as midgame. You build so much mana so quickly these phases are basically indistinguishable.
