Ramp is a GR big‑mana deck that accelerates quickly with enchantment auras and then cascades into huge threats. [[Arbor Elf]], [[Utopia Sprawl]], and [[Wild Growth]] create explosive starts, while cascade creatures like [[Boarding Party]] and [[Annoyed Altisaur]] provide free spells and a steady stream of large bodies. Initiative and venture cards such as [[Avenging Hunter]] and [[Writhing Chrysalis]] give the deck a powerful midgame payoff.

### Early game
Focus on ramping: attach [[Utopia Sprawl]] or [[Wild Growth]] early and pair them with [[Arbor Elf]] for double‑mana turns. [[Malevolent Rumble]] helps find missing pieces and adds extra material. The goal is to jump from setup turns into a fast six‑drop.

### Midgame
Cascade chains take over. A resolved [[Boarding Party]] or [[Annoyed Altisaur]] swings the tempo heavily in your favor, and [[Avenging Hunter]] pressures with the initiative. Your creatures are large enough to dominate combat and force unfavorable trades.

### Closing the game
Close by overwhelming the board with huge threats. You often win by chaining multiple cascade creatures in successive turns, or by protecting the initiative and letting dungeon triggers bury the opponent in advantage.
