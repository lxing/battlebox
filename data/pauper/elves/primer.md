Flood the board with mana creatures and use [[Priest of Titania]] with [[Quirion Ranger]] to convert that into huge mana and payoff threats like [[Nyxborn Hydra]] and [[Timberwatch Elf]].

### Early game
Lead with mana dorks like [[Llanowar Elves]] and [[Jaspera Sentinel]]. [[Quirion Ranger]] lets [[Priest of Titania]] explode.

### Midgame
Follow this three-step plan until you reach critical mass: 1) Convert elves into mana. 2) Convert mana into cards. 3) Convert cards into elves.

[[Winding Way]] and [[Lead the Stampede]] will keep your hand full, the rest is just mindlessly vomiting your elves onto the battlefield. [[Wellwisher]] is fantastic for stabilization. If you have a defensible board state, drop an [[Avenging Hunter]] to really turn up the pressure.

In postboard games, many decks will bring in board wipes, so you need to be more careful about going for a really wide board. At all times, ask yourself, "can I recover if all my elves get blown up"?

### Endgame
Finish by going wide and/or tall. Huge pumps from [[Timberwatch Elf]] or a single massive [[Nyxborn Hydra]] will blast through defenses. [[Wellwisher]] will completely bury any aggro or burn deck if unanswered.
