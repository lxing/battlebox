Elves is a mono‑green synergy deck that floods the board with mana creatures and leverages elf lords to produce explosive turns. [[Priest of Titania]] and [[Birchlore Rangers]] convert a wide board into huge mana, which fuels payoff threats like [[Nyxborn Hydra]] or overwhelming combat steps with [[Timberwatch Elf]].

### Early game
Lead with one‑mana elves such as [[Llanowar Elves]] and [[Jaspera Sentinel]] to build mana quickly. [[Quirion Ranger]] is key for accelerating and untapping lands or Priests, while [[Winding Way]] and [[Lead the Stampede]] keep your hand full in the early turns.

### Midgame
Once you have a critical mass, your mana engines take over. Use [[Priest of Titania]] to cast multiple spells per turn, and set up [[Timberwatch Elf]] or a large [[Nyxborn Hydra]] to force favorable attacks. [[Wellwisher]] can swing races by gaining massive chunks of life.

### Closing the game
Finish by going wide and pushing through a lethal combat step. Huge pumps from [[Timberwatch Elf]] or a single massive [[Nyxborn Hydra]] end games quickly once your board is established, and the deck can reload if the first wave is answered.
