Madness Burn is a BR aggressive deck that combines burn spells with the madness mechanic for explosive damage. [[Faithless Looting]], [[Voldaren Epicure]], and other discard outlets let you cast [[Fiery Temper]] and [[Alms of the Vein]] for reduced costs, while [[Lightning Bolt]] and [[Galvanic Blast]] provide classic reach.

### Early game
Lead with cheap threats and a discard outlet. [[Voldaren Epicure]] sets up madness triggers and chips in, while [[Goblin Tomb Raider]] grows quickly with artifact lands. Try to sequence so your first discard spell creates immediate value by enabling a madness burn spell.

### Midgame
Keep pressure on while refueling. [[Kitchen Imp]] and [[Sneaky Snacker]] apply evasive damage, and draw‑discard effects like [[Grab the Prize]] or [[Highway Robbery]] keep your hand stocked with burn. Use your removal to clear blockers and keep the life total moving down.

### Endgame
Finish with direct damage. A chain of madness spells plus [[Lightning Bolt]] often ends the game even through stabilization, and your remaining creatures can close the last points if the opponent runs out of answers.
