Use discard outlets to cast Madness spells for reduced cost and churn through your library. [[Kitchen Imp]] and [[Sneaky Snacker]] give you good evasive board presence.

### Nonobvious Combos
[[Grab the Prize]] + [[Sneaky Snacker]]

### Early game
Build your manabase and deploy [[Voldaren Epicure]] and [[Vampire's Kiss]] if available. Despite being a "burn" deck, you need a fair bit of mana to pay for a discard outlet and Madness spell at the same time, so don't rush into a pure rummage effect. The exception is using [[Grab the Prize]] or [[Highway Robbery]] to cheat out a quick [[Sneaky Snacker]] on turn 2.

### Midgame
Start chaining discard enablers and Madness burn spells and [[Kitchen Imp]]. There is not much to say here, the deck should flow like butter with all the card selection. Discard any lands beyond 4-5. When deciding between removal or going to the face, generally favor direct damage unless it's to mow down a blocker.

### Endgame
Keep going to the face. Once you reach critical artifact mass, your reserved [[Galvanic Blast]] will deliver the killing blow.
