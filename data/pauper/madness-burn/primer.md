Madness Burn is a BR aggro deck that uses discard outlets to cast madness spells for reduced cost and keep pressure constant. Core enablers like [[Faithless Looting]], [[Grab the Prize]], and [[Highway Robbery]] turn on efficient payoffs such as [[Fiery Temper]] and [[Alms of the Vein]], while [[Kitchen Imp]] and [[Sneaky Snacker]] give you good evasive board presence.

### Early game
Build your manabase and deploy [[Voldaren Epicure]] and [[Vampire's Kiss]] if available. Despite being a "burn" deck, you need a fair bit of mana to pay for a discard outlet and madness spell at the same time, so don't rush into a raw discard spell. The exception is using [[Grab the Prize]] or [[Highway Robbery]] to cheat out a quick [[Sneaky Snacker]] on turn 2.

### Midgame
Start chaining discard enablers and madness burn spells and [[Kitchen Imp]]. There is not much to say here, the deck should flow like butter with all the card selection. Discard any lands beyond 4-5. When deciding between removal or going to the face, generally favor direct damage unless it's to mow down a blocker.

### Endgame
Keep going to the face. Once you reach critical artifact mass, your reserved [[Galvanic Blast]] can deliver the killing blow.
