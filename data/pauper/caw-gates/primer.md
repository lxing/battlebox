Turn small creatures into huge attackers with [[Basilisk Gate]], backed by a dense cantrip suite and some solid interaction. [[Prismatic Strands]] is absolutely brutal on aggro and other midrange races.

### Nonobvious Combos
[[The Modern Age|The Modern Age / Vector Glider]] + [[Sacred Cat]] / [[Prismatic Strands]]
[[Brainstorm]] + [[Squadron Hawk]]

### Early game
Develop Gates and smooth draws with cantrips. Prioritize hitting every single land drop. In the early stages, it's usually better to interact instead of deploying threats or trying to setup your engine. Your power scales with Gate count, and that takes quite a while to setup, so an early creature is not necessary unless you need a blocker or have nothing better to do.

### Midgame
Dig for [[Basilisk Gate]] and start deploying bodies. Lifelink from [[Sacred Cat]] and [[Prismatic Strands]] make you incredibly good at racing, so don't be afraid to swing away. 

Grab a ton of card advantage with [[Squadron Hawk]] and [[Brainstorm]], or Embalm / [[Prismatic Strands]] value with [[The Modern Age / Vector Glider]]. Keep making land drops and get [[Lórien Revealed]] online.

### Endgame
Once you stabilize, use [[Basilisk Gate]] to turn a flier or [[Guardian of the Guildpact]] into a huge evasive clock. The size advantage here is crushing against decks that try to play fair combat.
