Caw-Gates is an Azorius control deck that wins by turning small, resilient creatures into huge attackers with [[Basilisk Gate]]. The core threats are [[Squadron Hawk]] and [[Sacred Cat]], backed by a dense cantrip suite with [[Brainstorm]] and [[Preordain]]. [[The Modern Age / Vector Glider]] filters cards and works well with graveyard spells like [[Prismatic Strands]] or embalm to generate extra value.

### Early game
Prioritize developing gates and smoothing draws with cantrips. A typical start is a cheap threat plus card selection, keeping [[Counterspell]] available when you can. [[Lórien Revealed]] helps fix mana and ensures you hit land drops in a gate-heavy manabase.

### Midgame
Shift into a controlling posture: trade resources with [[Journey to Nowhere]] and countermagic, then set up [[Prismatic Strands]] to blank big combat steps. Your small bodies scale quickly once multiple gates are online, so timing your Basilisk activation matters more than raw power.

### Closing the game
Once you stabilize, use [[Basilisk Gate]] to turn a flier or a protected threat like [[Guardian of the Guildpact]] into a fast clock. The deck is strongest when it forces opponents to respect both the control plan and the sudden burst damage from gates.
