Caw-Gates is a WU control deck that wins by turning numerous small creatures into huge attackers with [[Basilisk Gate]]. The core threats are [[Squadron Hawk]] and [[Sacred Cat]], backed by a dense cantrip suite with [[Brainstorm]] and [[Preordain]] and some solid interaction. [[Prismatic Strands]] is absolutely brutal on aggro.

### Early game
Develop Gates and smooth draws with cantrips. Prioritize hitting every single land drop. In the early stages, it's usually better to interact instead of deploying threats or trying to setup your engine. Your power scales with Gate count, and that takes quite a while to setup, so an early creature is not necessary unless you need a blocker or have nothing better to do.

### Midgame
Dig for [[Basilisk Gate]] and start deploying your bodies. Lifelink from [[Sacred Cat]] and [[Prismatic Strands]] make you incredibly good at racing, so don't be afraid to swing away. 

Grab a ton of card advantage with [[Squardon Hawk]] and [[Brainstorm]], or Embalm / [[Prismatic Strands]] value with [[The Modern Age / Vector Glider]]. Try to make every single land drop and get [[Lórien Revealed]] online.

### Endgame
Once you stabilize, use [[Basilisk Gate]] to turn a flier or [[Guardian of the Guildpact]] into a fast evasive clock. You have decent sustained pressure as every tiny creature can become a massive threat during each attack step, though wide boards are still capable of stalling you.
