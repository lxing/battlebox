+4 [[Red Elemental Blast]]
+1 [[Pyroblast]]
+2 [[Cast into the Fire]]
-2 [[Cast Down]]
-3 [[Galvanic Blast]]
-2 [[Toxin Analysis]]

Standard blast package. Spot removal like [[Cast Down]] is considerably less useful. [[Cast into the Fire]] is a more reliable 2-for-1 and good against the [[Gorilla Shaman]] they'll inevitably bring in.
