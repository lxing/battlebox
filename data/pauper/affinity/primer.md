Use artifact lands and cheap artifacts to power fast affinity spells. Various sacrifice effects also give an amazing recursion engine; this deck is an unmatched combo of terrifying speed and grinding capability. Most decks dedicate a huge slice of sideboard to Affinity for good reason.

### Early game
Develop as many cheap artifacts as you can, then chain them into [[Thoughtcast]] and [[Myr Enforcer]] before cashing them in for [[Reckoner's Bargain]]. As ridiculous as it sounds, this is the early game for Affinity.

### Midgame
Grind away with [[Refurbished Familiar]] and [[Reckoner's Bargain]] chains. In the event someone is faster than you, [[Krark-Clan Shaman]] and optionally [[Toxin Analysis]] will wipe any board state. Construct a flying brick shithouse with [[Kenku Artificer]] and [[Drossforge Bridge]].

### Endgame
Recur your board repeatedly with [[Blood Fountain]]. After enough chip damage, one or two [[Galvanic Blast]] will very quickly end a game. The singleton [[Makeshift Munitions]] is also very good at attrition with all the sacrifice fodder. This deck can come back from incredibly far behind, so never give up!
