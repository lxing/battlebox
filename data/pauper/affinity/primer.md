Affinity uses artifact lands and cheap artifacts to power fast affinity spells and steady card advantage. This list leans on [[Ichor Wellspring]] and [[Blood Fountain]] as fuel for [[Deadly Dispute]] and [[Reckoner's Bargain]], while [[Galvanic Blast]] and [[Cast Down]] keep opposing threats in check.

### Early game
Develop artifacts and mana so [[Thoughtcast]] and [[Myr Enforcer]] are online quickly. Your cheap artifacts and artifact lands turn on early discounted threats while stocking the board for later sacrifice value.

### Midgame
Use sacrifice timing to turn expendable artifacts into cards and life while keeping affinity counts high. [[Refurbished Familiar]] and [[Kenku Artificer]] apply pressure, and a well-timed [[Krark-Clan Shaman]] can reset go-wide boards without losing your larger bodies.

### Closing the game
Close with oversized threats like [[Myr Enforcer]] backed by reach from [[Galvanic Blast]] or attrition from [[Makeshift Munitions]]. The deck often wins by converting extra artifacts into damage while staying ahead on resources.
