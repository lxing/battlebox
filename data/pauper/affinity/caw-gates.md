-1 [[Candy Trail]]

-2 [[Galvanic Blast]]
-1 [[Toxin Analysis]]

Standard blast package, and [[Krark-Clan Shaman]] to fight the wide board. [[Kenku Artificer]] makes good indestructible blockers, but be warned they are susceptible to [[Journey to Nowhere]].

Spot removal like [[Cast Down]] is considerably less useful. [[Cast into the Fire]] is a more reliable 2-for-1 and good against the [[Gorilla Shaman]] they'll inevitably bring in.
