+2 [[Cast into the Fire]]
+2 [[Gorilla Shaman]]
+1 [[Toxin Analysis]]
-1 [[Makeshift Munitions]]
-4 [[Refurbished Familiar]]

Race with [[Toxin Analysis]] and [[Reckoner's Bargain]] + [[Myr Enforcer]]. [[Gorilla Shaman]] is pretty good against their Blood tokens and artifact land base, but don't get carried away while they burn your face off. Need more removal to fight their own Gorillas.
