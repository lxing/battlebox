Fuel a titanic removal suite with the [[Deadly Dispute]] + fodder engine. Once stabilized, pressure using the Monarch and Initiative R&D disasters.

### Nonobvious Combos
[[Deadly Dispute]] + [[Ichor Wellspring]] / [[Lembas]]

### Early game
Prioritize land drops and fodder setup. [[Khalni Garden]], [[Ichor Wellspring]], [[Tithing Blade / Consuming Sepulcher]], and [[Lembas]] are ideal here. Use spot removal to survive the first few turns and buy time to develop your value loop.

### Midgame
Take over with repeated card advantage. Spam [[Deadly Dispute]], [[Eviscerator's Insight]], and [[Fanatical Offering]] to churn your fodder into cards. Sweep with [[Crypt Rats]], then setup an [[Avenging Hunter]], [[Thorn of the Black Rose]], or [[Writhing Chrysalis]] to take over the board.

### Endgame
Play for pure attrition. Protect the Monarch or Initiative and grind the board to dust.
