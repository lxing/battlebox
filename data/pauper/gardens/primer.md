Gardens is a BG midrange control deck built to grind. It uses [[Khalni Garden]] tokens and cheap artifacts like [[Ichor Wellspring]] and [[Lembas]] to fuel sacrifice draw engines such as [[Deadly Dispute]] and [[Reckoner's Bargain]]. A dense removal suite ([[Defile]], [[Cast Down]], [[Snuff Out]], [[Spinning Darkness]]) keeps the board clear while you accumulate value.

### Early game
Prioritize land drops and setup. [[Khalni Garden]] gives you early blockers and sacrifice fodder, and a timely [[Duress]] can clear the way for your engines. [[Tithing Blade / Consuming Sepulcher]] is a key stabilizer against single threats and helps cushion life totals.

### Midgame
Take over with repeatable advantage. [[Thorn of the Black Rose]] delivers the monarch, and [[Avenging Hunter]] brings the initiative, forcing opponents to answer your steady stream of cards. [[Crypt Rats]] functions as a flexible sweeper to reset wide boards when you are ahead on resources.

### Closing the game
Once you have the game under control, win by attrition. Recursive value from [[Witch's Cottage]] or a large [[Crypt Rats]] activation can finish games, and [[Troll of Khazad-dûm]] provides a sturdy threat once the opponent is out of answers.
