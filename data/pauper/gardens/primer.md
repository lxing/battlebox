Gardens is a BGr grindy midrange-control deck that wins by trading resources and generating steady value. The shell uses small artifacts and tokens as fuel for [[Deadly Dispute]] and [[Fanatical Offering]], while a dense removal suite like [[Defile]], [[Cast Down]], [[Snuff Out]], and [[Spinning Darkness]] trades down opposing threats. The deck pivots from stabilization to pressure using Monarch and Initiative.

### Early game
Prioritize land drops and fodder setup. [[Khalni Garden]], [[Ichor Wellspring]], [[Tithing Blade / Consuming Sepulcher]], and [[Lembas]] are ideal here. Use spot removal to survive the first few turns and buy time to develop your value loop.

### Midgame
Take over with repeated card advantage. Spam  [[Deadly Dispute]], [[Eviscerator's Insight]], and [[Fanatical Offering]] to churn your fodder into cards. Sweep with [[Crypt Rats]], then setup an [[Avenging Hunter]], [[Thorn of the Black Rose]], or [[Writhing Chrysalis]] to take over the board.

### Endgame
Play for pure attrition. Protect the Monarch or Initiative and grind the board to dust.
