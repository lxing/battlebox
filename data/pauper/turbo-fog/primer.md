Turbo Fog is a UG control deck that aims to prevent combat damage indefinitely while drawing through its deck. The core plan is chaining fog effects like [[Moment's Peace]], [[Respite]], and [[Tangle]] while using card draw to keep your hand full and maintain land drops.

### Early game
Focus on setup and survival. [[Growth Spiral]] and [[Lórien Revealed]] help accelerate and fix mana, while [[Brainstorm]] and [[Accumulated Knowledge]] dig for the next fog or counterspell. It’s fine to take some early damage as long as you can stabilize with a fog when needed.

### Midgame
Once you have mana and cards, start locking combat. Rotate fogs and counterspells like [[Arcane Denial]] and [[Disrupt]] to stop key noncombat threats. [[Weather the Storm]] and [[Radiant Fountain]] provide life buffers that buy more time.

### Closing the game
Win by decking the opponent. [[Stream of Thought]] recycles your fogs and interaction so you can outlast the opposing threats, then draw or mill them out while keeping combat locked down.
