Synthesizer is a mono‑red aggro deck built around cheap artifacts and explosive token turns. [[Experimental Synthesizer]] and [[Implement of Combustion]] provide card flow while stocking artifacts for [[Kuldotha Rebirth]]. The deck converts those tokens into fast damage with [[Goblin Bushwhacker]] and uses burn to finish.

### Early game
Establish a board quickly with low‑cost creatures and artifacts. [[Voldaren Epicure]] and [[Clockwork Percussionist]] provide early pressure and artifact fodder, while [[Goblin Blast-Runner]] and [[Goblin Tomb Raider]] scale up with your artifact count. Look for early Rebirth turns to go wide.

### Midgame
Leverage burst damage. [[Goblin Bushwhacker]] turns a board of tokens into a lethal attack, and burn spells like [[Lightning Bolt]], [[Chain Lightning]], and [[Galvanic Blast]] clear blockers or go to the face. [[Experimental Synthesizer]] keeps the cards coming through your cheap spells.

### Endgame
Finish by chaining burn and a final wide attack. Even if the board stalls, direct damage and sacrificed artifacts keep pressure high, and a late Bushwhacker often supplies the last points.
