White Weenie is a mono-white aggro deck that wins by going wide with efficient creatures and token makers, then pushing through a big combat step. The core plan revolves around cheap bodies like [[Thraben Inspector]] and [[Novice Inspector]], value bounce with [[Kor Skyfisher]], and a burst finisher from [[Battle Screech]] plus [[Guardians' Pledge]].

### Early game
Curve out with your one- and two-drops, then use [[Thraben Inspector]] and [[Novice Inspector]] to generate Clues that keep your hand full. [[Raffine's Informant]] and [[Militia Bugler]] help smooth draws, and [[Eagles of the North]] can be cycled early to hit land drops.

### Midgame
Start building a wide board and protect it. [[Prismatic Strands]] lets you blank combat steps, and [[Thraben Charm]] provides flexible interaction. [[Kor Skyfisher]] reuses your ETB value while adding to your flying pressure.

### Endgame
Close with a decisive attack: [[Battle Screech]] supplies evasive bodies and [[Guardians' Pledge]] turns a crowded board into lethal damage. [[Idyllic Grange]] can add another point of pressure when you need to push through the last damage.
