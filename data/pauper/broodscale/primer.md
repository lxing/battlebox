Broodscale is a BG combo deck built around [[Basking Broodscale]] plus [[Sadistic Glee]]. The loop creates Eldrazi Spawn, sacrifices them for mana, then Glee adds another counter, repeating for infinite colorless mana and an arbitrarily large creature. [[Nadier's Nightblade]] turns the loop into a clean kill by draining on each sacrifice.

### Early game
Lead with fixing and cheap artifacts like [[Chromatic Star]] and [[Ichor Wellspring]] to smooth mana and set up sacrifice value. Use [[Duress]] to clear interaction and [[Malevolent Rumble]] to find missing pieces while adding another token to work with.

### Midgame
Assemble the combo and protect it with [[Snakeskin Veil]]. If the combo isn’t safe yet, you can grind with [[Deadly Dispute]] and [[Eviscerator's Insight]] to keep cards flowing while maintaining artifact density for future turns.

### Closing the game
Once the loop is live, win immediately with infinite drain from [[Nadier's Nightblade]] or by attacking with a massive Broodscale. When opponents are holding interaction, take the slower line and force them to answer your resource engine before you commit.
