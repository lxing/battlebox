Combo [[Basking Broodscale]] and [[Sadistic Glee]] for infinite colorless mana, an arbitrarily large Broodscale, and infinite sac effects. [[Nadier's Nightblade]] converts to an instant kill by draining on each sacrifice.

### Early game
Lead with fixing and cheap artifacts like [[Chromatic Star]] and [[Ichor Wellspring]] to smooth mana and set up sacrifice value. Use [[Duress]] to clear interaction and [[Malevolent Rumble]] to dig. You don't have much defense against aggressive decks, so focus on the combo.

### Midgame
Assemble the combo and protect it with [[Snakeskin Veil]]. If the coast isn't clear, you can grind with [[Deadly Dispute]] and [[Eviscerator's Insight]] to build up a material advantage while digging for more protection/disruption.

### Endgame
Same as midgame. The draw package gives you quite a bit of staying power.
