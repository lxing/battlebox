Skred is a UR control‑tempo deck that pairs blue card selection and countermagic with red removal. [[Skred]] and [[Lightning Bolt]] handle early threats, while a dense cantrip suite ([[Brainstorm]], [[Ponder]], [[Preordain]]) fuels graveyard‑based finishers like [[Tolarian Terror]].

### Early game
Open with cantrips to smooth your draws and find interaction. Use [[Skred]] and [[Lightning Bolt]] to keep the board clear while holding up [[Spell Pierce]] or [[Counterspell]] when possible. [[Augur of Bolas]] helps find the spells you need and blocks early attackers.

### Midgame
Once your graveyard is stocked, land [[Tolarian Terror]] and shift to protecting it. [[Lórien Revealed]] keeps lands flowing and provides extra card selection, while [[Murmuring Mystic]] can take over longer games by generating a board from your spell density.

### Endgame
Finish by riding a protected threat to the finish line. A single [[Tolarian Terror]] backed by counters often ends games quickly, and Mystic tokens provide a backup plan when the game goes long.
