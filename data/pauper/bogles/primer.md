Bogles is a GW hexproof aura deck: stick a protected creature, then stack efficient enchantments to end the game quickly. The core threats are [[Slippery Bogle]], [[Gladecover Scout]], and [[Silhana Ledgewalker]], while payoffs like [[Ethereal Armor]] and [[Ancestral Mask]] scale with every aura you deploy.

### Early game
Mulligan toward a hexproof creature plus a couple of auras or fixing. Use [[Utopia Sprawl]] and [[Abundant Growth]] to smooth mana and keep the spells flowing, then land a threat before you start piling on enchantments.

### Midgame
Stack your best damage auras first and prioritize evasion. [[Rancor]] and [[Armadillo Cloak]] help you win races, while [[Cartouche of Solidarity]] can leave behind an extra body to play around sacrifice effects.

### Closing the game
Once a single creature is large enough, push damage through and avoid giving opponents windows to break the chain. Bogles is strongest at racing, but it can be vulnerable to edicts or counterspells, so keep a backup creature or token when possible.
