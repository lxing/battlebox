Stick a protected creature, then stack dumb enchantments to end the game quickly.

### Early game
Mulligan toward a hexproof creature plus a couple of auras or fixing. Use [[Utopia Sprawl]] and [[Abundant Growth]] to smooth mana and keep the spells flowing, then land a threat before you start piling on enchantments.

### Midgame
Stack your best damage auras first and prioritize evasion. [[Armadillo Cloak]] will win you any damage race, while [[Cartouche of Solidarity]] and [[Malevolent Rumble]] provide some extra fodder against sacrifice effects.

### Endgame
[[Ancestral Mask]]. Hulk Smash.
