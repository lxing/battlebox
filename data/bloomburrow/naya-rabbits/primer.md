Few strategies can withstand the sheer weight of rabbit fornication! Spam tokens everywhere with go-wide rabbits. This deck is packed to the brim with token generators and payoffs.

Flood the board with [[Pawpatch Recruit]], [[Hop to It]], and [[Jacked Rabbit]]. [[Baylen|Baylen, the Haymaker]] and [[Caretaker's Talent]] will accrue value as you build up your bunnies. Then stick one of the numerous anthem effects between [[Warren Warleader]], [[Finneas|Finneas, Ace Archer]], and [[Valley Questcaller]] to complete the steamroll.

Tip: rabbits are unstoppable when they get a full warren rolling, but lack reach and are susceptible to sweepers. Be mindful of overextension!
