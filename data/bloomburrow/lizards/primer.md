Use your forked tongue to lick your opponents and your own eyeballs at the same time! Lizards get straight to the point with early aggression and burn to finish your opponents off. Use [[Iridescent Vinelasher]] and [[Hired Claw]] to get in early hits, then scale up the damage with [[Gev|Gev, Scaled Scorch]] and [[Valley Flamecaller]].

[[Fireglass Mentor]], [[Flamecache Gecko]], and [[Party Thrasher]] provide loads of card selection and light card advantage in the midgame. The last two feed a light discard subtheme with [[Fiery Temper]].

Tip: Hang onto your extra land drops. A [[Vinelasher|Iridescent Vinelasher]] and offspring with [[Flamecaller|Valley Flamecaller]] and [[Bloodstained Mire]] equals 8 damage to the face in the late game!
