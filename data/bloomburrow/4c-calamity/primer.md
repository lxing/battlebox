Evoke the terror of high-cost elementals! [[Glarb|Glarb, Calamity's Augur]] digs them off the top of your library and [[Helga|Helga, Skittish Seer]] generates oodles of mana to power them out. Accelerate with [[Birds of Paradise]] and Helga, stabilize with some fatties, then bury your opponents in nonstop value.

There is a big-butt subtheme where [[Fecund Greenshell]] plays well with Helga, Glarb, and [[Beza, the Bounding Spring]].

Engines:
- [[Up the Beanstalk]]
- [[Glarb, Calamity's Augur]]
- [[Helga, Skittish Seer]]

Fat Elementals:
- [[Beza, the Bounding Spring]]
- [[Solitude]]
- [[Fecund Greenshell]]
- [[Mulldrifter]]
- [[Leyline Binding]] (honorary mention)
