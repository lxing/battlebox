Squeak! Pow your opponents into submission with an engine of Valiant enablers like [[Mouse Claws|Shuko]], [[Manifold Mouse]], and [[Mabel|Mabel, Heir to Cragflame]] that generate repeatable targeting, and Valiant payoffs that generate value on being targeted.

Keep a balance of enablers and payoffs to generate constant pressure. [[Heartfire Hero]] and [[Flowerfoot Swordmaster]] come out of the gates swinging from turn one. [[Emberheart Challenger]] and [[Whiskervale Forerunner]] provide a stream of card advantage in long games. To assemble the ultimate mouse, tutor up [[Sword of Fire and Ice]] and [[Sword of Light and Shadow]] as an unstoppable finisher.

Tip: Target [[Emberheart Challenger]] before playing your land drop if possible!
Tip: You are legally required to refer to [[Shuko]] as [[Mouse Claws|Shuko]] for the duration of the game.
