Pow!!! Squeak your opponents into submission. This deck runs on an engine of two card types: Valiant enablers that generate repeatable targeting, and Valiant payoffs that generate value on being targeted.

Keep a balance of both enablers and payoffs to generate constant pressure against your opponents. [[Emberheart Challenger]] and [[Whiskervale Forerunner]] provide a steady stream of card advantage in the long game. To assemble the ultimate mouse, tutor up [[Sword of Fire and Ice]] and [[Sword of Light and Shadow]] as an unstoppable finisher.

Enablers:
- [[Stoneforge Mystic]] -> [[Shuko]] + other equipment
- [[Manifold Mouse]]
- [[Mabel, Heir to Cragflame]]
- [[Rockface Village]]

Payoffs:
- [[Emberheart Challenger]]
- [[Whiskervale Forerunner]]
- [[Heartfire Hero]]
- [[Mouse Trapper]]
- [[Flowerfoot Swordmaster]]
