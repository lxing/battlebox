Evoke the terror of high-cost elementals! [[Glarb|Glarb, Calamity's Augur]] digs them off the top of your library and [[Helga|Helga, Skittish Seer]] generates oodles of mana to power them out. Accelerate with [[Birds of Paradise]] and Helga, stabilize with [[Beza|Beza, the Bounding Spring]] and [[Leyline Binding]], then bury your opponents in nonstop value courtesy of [[Solitude]] and [[Mulldrifter]].

In prolonged battles, pull ahead with the big-butt subtheme where [[Fecund Greenshell]] turns every [[Helga|Helga, Skittish Seer]], [[Glarb|Glarb, Calamity's Augur]], and [[Beza|Beza, the Bounding Spring]] into a land drop.

Tip: Drop an early [[Up the Beanstalk]] to keep the cards flowing.
