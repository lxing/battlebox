Build an unstoppable engine around repeatable enchantment-based card draw. [[Argothian Enchantress]] and [[Enchantress's Presence]] turn every enchantment into a cantrip, while [[Wild Growth]], [[Exploration]], and [[Serra's Sanctum]] accelerate your mana and help churn through your deck. Prison pieces like [[Elephant Grass]], [[Worship]], and [[Solitary Confinement]] stabilize until you have critical mass

### Early game
Prioritize cheap development like [[Wild Growth]], [[Exploration]], and [[Mirri's Guile]]. Get out an enchantress effect ASAP. [[Elephant Grass]] can buy time against aggressive decks, but be wary of stifling your own development with the upkeep cost.

### Midgame
With the core engine online, you can sculpt your hand and lock the game. Use [[Sterling Grove]] or [[Enlightened Tutor]] to dig out [[Solitary Confinement]] or [[Worship]] to completely shut off combat. [[Seal of Cleansing]] and [[Parallax Wave]] provide reasonable interaction against any board presence the prison pieces cannot handle.

### Endgame
Finish by converting your board into a win condition. [[Mobilization]] is steady stream of soldiers to stabilize and pull ahead, while [[Opalescence]] plus [[Parallax Wave]] generate a dominant board state on the spot. Once you are drawing multiple cards a turn and producing large mana from [[Serra's Sanctum]], your late game is completely inevitable. There are a few [[Replenish]] as a backbreaking pseudo-combo finish if your opponent is able to keep up with enchrantment removal.
