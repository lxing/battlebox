Enchantress is a green-white engine deck built around repeatable enchantment-based card draw. [[Argothian Enchantress]] and [[Enchantress's Presence]] turn every enchantment into a cantrip, while [[Wild Growth]], [[Exploration]], and [[Serra's Sanctum]] accelerate you to light speed. The deck uses prison enchantments like [[Elephant Grass]], [[Worship]], and [[Solitary Confinement]] to stabilize while it assembles a resilient board.

### Early game
Prioritize cheap development like [[Wild Growth]], [[Exploration]], and [[Mirri's Guile]] to accelerate. Get out an enchantress effect ASAP too. [[Elephant Grass]] can buy time against aggressive decks, but be wary of stifling your own development with the upkeep cost.

### Midgame
With the core engine online, you can sculpt your hand and lock the game. Use [[Sterling Grove]] or [[Enlightened Tutor]] to find silver bullets, and lean on [[Solitary Confinement]] or [[Worship]] to completely shut off combat. [[Seal of Cleansing]] and [[Parallax Wave]] provide reasonable interaction against any board presence the prison pieces cannot handle.

### Endgame
Finish by converting your board into a win condition. [[Opalescence]] plus [[Parallax Wave]] can give you a dominant board state, while [[Mobilization]] provides a steady stream of soldiers if the game stalls. Once you are drawing multiple cards a turn and producing large mana from [[Serra's Sanctum]], your late game is completely inevitable.
