Enchantress is a green-white engine deck built around repeatable enchantment-based card draw. [[Argothian Enchantress]] and [[Enchantress's Presence]] turn every enchantment into a cantrip, while [[Wild Growth]], [[Exploration]], and [[Serra's Sanctum]] accelerate you into powerful turns. The deck uses protective enchantments like [[Elephant Grass]] and tutoring via [[Sterling Grove]] to stabilize while it assembles a resilient board.

### Early game
Prioritize an enchantress effect and cheap mana development. A start of [[Wild Growth]] plus [[Exploration]] or [[Mirri's Guile]] helps you hit land drops and dig toward the engine. If you expect early pressure, [[Elephant Grass]] buys time while you build up an enchantment count. [[Sterling Grove]] can both protect key pieces and set up your next draw step.

### Midgame
With the draw engine online, you can sculpt your hand and lock the game. Use [[Sterling Grove]] or [[Enlightened Tutor]] to find silver bullets, and lean on [[Solitary Confinement]] or [[Worship]] when you need to shut off combat. [[Seal of Cleansing]] answers problematic permanents, and [[Replenish]] lets you recover quickly after interaction or discard.

### Closing the game
Finish by converting your board into a win condition. [[Opalescence]] plus [[Parallax Wave]] can clear the way and turn your enchantments into attackers, while [[Mobilization]] provides a steady stream of soldiers if the game stalls. Once you are drawing multiple cards a turn and producing large mana from [[Serra's Sanctum]], your late game quickly becomes inevitable.
