Gro-a-Tog is a tempo-control deck that mixes efficient cantrips and countermagic with a fast clock. [[Quirion Dryad]] grows quickly off cheap blue spells, and [[Psychatog]] offers a late-game threat that can end the game in one or two swings. The mana base is greedy but flexible, and tools like [[Gush]] and [[Mox Diamond]] let you keep up in mana while still deploying threats and holding up interaction.

### Early game
Use cantrips like [[Opt]] and [[Portent]] to smooth draws and find either a threat or protection. If you can, land [[Quirion Dryad]] early and start chaining cheap spells to grow it out of removal range. Keep mana open for [[Counterspell]] and [[Swords to Plowshares]] when you expect to be pressured.

### Midgame
Once a threat sticks, switch into a tempo posture. [[Gush]] can be a big midgame swing, refilling your hand while triggering Dryad and keeping mana available. [[Meddling Mage]] helps lock out key answers or combo pieces, and the small suite of disruption (including [[Daze]]) lets you press an advantage without overextending.

### Closing the game
Finish with a large [[Psychatog]] attack or a Dryad that has grown out of control. [[Armageddon]] is a powerful closer when you have a threat on board and can float or recover mana with [[Mox Diamond]]. Be deliberate about when to cash in [[Gush]] and discard cards to Psychatog so you don’t leave yourself exposed to a blowout.
