Play an OG tempo strategy that overloads cantrips with [[Quirion Dryad]] to pressure while always having the right answers. The mana base is greedy and powerful, dipping into every slice of the color pie. Use [[Gush]], [[Mox Diamond]], and [[Armageddon]] to freely trade mana, card advantage, and tempo at your discretion.

### Early game
Use cantrips like [[Opt]] and [[Portent]] to smooth draws and find either a threat or protection. If you can, land [[Quirion Dryad]] early and try to grow it out of removal range. Disrupt with [[Counterspell]], [[Daze]], and [[Swords to Plowshares]].

### Midgame
Once a threat sticks, switch into a tempo posture and try to beat down your opponent while stymieing their gameplan. If you can land it while ahead on board, [[Armageddon]] is basically an instant win. Be strategic about your disruption: if [[Quirion Dryad]] and [[Psychatog]] can steamroll an opposing creature, it's probably not worth countering or removing.

### Endgame
Befitting the deck name, keep chaining cantrips to grow your threats out of control. Keep digging and trading for a favorable [[Armageddon]].
