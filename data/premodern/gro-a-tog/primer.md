Gro-a-Tog is a tempo deck that mixes efficient cantrips and countermagic with a fast clock. [[Quirion Dryad]] grows quickly off cheap blue spells, and [[Psychatog]] offers a late-game threat that can end the game in one or two swings. The mana base is greedy but flexible, and tools like [[Gush]] and [[Mox Diamond]] let you keep up in mana while still deploying threats and holding up interaction.

### Early game
Use cantrips like [[Opt]] and [[Portent]] to smooth draws and find either a threat or protection. If you can, land [[Quirion Dryad]] early and try to grow it out of removal range. Disrupt with [[Counterspell]], [[Daze]], and [[Swords to Plowshares]].

### Midgame
Once a threat sticks, switch into a tempo posture. If you're ahead on board, [[Armageddon]] is basically an instant win. Be strategic about your disruption: if [[Quirion Dryad]] and [[Psychatog]] can steamroll an opposing creature, it's probably not worth countering or removing.

### Closing the game
Befitting the deck name, keep chaining cantrips to grow your threats out of control. Keep angling for a favorable [[Armageddon]]. Gush is the only source of card advantage, but it's a great one.
