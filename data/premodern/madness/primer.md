Madness is a tempo deck that converts discard into free or discounted threats. [[Wild Mongrel]] and [[Careful Study]] enable the engine, letting you cast [[Basking Rootwalla]] and [[Arrogant Wurm]] at a steep discount. With permission like [[Counterspell]] and [[Daze]], the deck can apply pressure while staying reactive.

### Early game
Prioritize an enabler and a cheap threat. [[Wild Mongrel]] is the most important early play because it turns every card into flexibility, while [[Careful Study]] helps you line up madness spells quickly. Holding up [[Daze]] or [[Counterspell]] early can protect your board and slow down opposing development.

### Midgame
This is where the deck’s efficiency shines. Use [[Frantic Search]] to refuel and trigger multiple madness spells in a single turn. [[Survival of the Fittest]] adds a tutor angle that can find the right threat or utility creature, with [[Squee, Goblin Nabob]] providing repeatable discard fodder. If you have [[Wonder]] in the graveyard, your board becomes much harder to block.

### Closing the game
Close by keeping pressure on with evasive or oversized threats while you counter their outs. A timely [[Arrogant Wurm]] or pumped [[Wild Mongrel]] ends games quickly once you’re ahead. Be mindful of when to discard key cards and when to hold up interaction; the deck wins by balancing speed with just enough disruption.
