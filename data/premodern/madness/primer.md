Use various Madness enablers to cheat on mana and play a tempo game. [[Wild Mongrel]], [[Frantic Search]] and [[Careful Study]] enable the engine, letting you cast [[Basking Rootwalla]] and [[Arrogant Wurm]] at a steep discount. With cheap permission like [[Counterspell]] and [[Daze]], you can apply pressure while leaving up just enough reactivity to squeeze through a win.

### Early game
Prioritize a cheap repeatable enabler. [[Wild Mongrel]] and [[Survival of the Fittest]] are the lynchpins of the deck.

### Midgame
This is where the deck’s efficiency shines. Build up a large and efficient board of [[Basking Rootwalla]] and [[Arrogant Wurm]]. Grab [[Squee, Goblin Nabob]] with [[Survival of the Fittest]] and start tutoring out every creature in your library. Disrupt with countermagic as needed; most of your Madness enablers play well at instant speed.

### Endgame
[[Survival of the Fittest]] gives you nonstop pressure against control decks. If the board stalls, dump [[Wonder]] in the graveyard for an alpha strike or use the infuriating [[Waterfront Bouncer]] + [[Gilded Drake]] combo.
