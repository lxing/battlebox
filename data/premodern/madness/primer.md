Madness is a tempo deck that converts discard into free or discounted threats. [[Wild Mongrel]], [[Frantic Search]] and [[Careful Study]] enable the engine, letting you cast [[Basking Rootwalla]] and [[Arrogant Wurm]] at a steep discount. With cheap permission like [[Counterspell]] and [[Daze]], the deck can apply pressure while leaving up just enough reactivity to squeeze through the win.

### Early game
Prioritize an enabler and a cheap threat. [[Wild Mongrel]] is the most important early play because it's repeatable discard, though [[Careful Study]] can enable Madness in a pinch.

### Midgame
This is where the deck’s efficiency shines. Use [[Frantic Search]] to refuel and trigger cheap madness madness spells to build up a large and efficient board. [[Survival of the Fittest]] adds a tutor angle that can find the right threat or utility creature, with [[Squee, Goblin Nabob]] providing repeatable discard fodder to gain card advantage.

### Endgame
Close by keeping pressure on with evasive or oversized threats while you counter their scariest spells. Your endgame trumps are [[Wonder]] for an alpha strike and the infuriating [[Waterfront Bouncer]] + [[Gilded Drake]] combo.
