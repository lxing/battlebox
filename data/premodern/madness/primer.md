Madness is a tempo deck that converts discard into free or discounted threats. [[Wild Mongrel]], [[Frantic Search]] and [[Careful Study]] enable the engine, letting you cast [[Basking Rootwalla]] and [[Arrogant Wurm]] at a steep discount. With cheap permission like [[Counterspell]] and [[Daze]], the deck can apply pressure while leaving up just enough reactivity to squeeze through the win.

### Early game
Prioritize a cheap repeatable enabler. [[Wild Mongrel]] is the most important early play because it's repeatable discard, [[Survival of the Fittest]] is the next best option.

### Midgame
This is where the deck’s efficiency shines. Use [[Frantic Search]] to refuel and trigger cheap Madness spells to build up a large and efficient board. Grab [[Squee, Goblin Nabob]] with [[Survival of the Fittest]] and start tutoring out every creature in your library. Disrupt with countermagic as needed; all your Madness spells play well at instant speed.

### Endgame
Close by keeping pressure with evasive oversized threats. Your endgame trumps are [[Wonder]] for an alpha strike and the infuriating [[Waterfront Bouncer]] + [[Gilded Drake]] combo.
