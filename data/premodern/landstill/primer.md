Landstill is a slow control deck that turns a stable board into a stream of cards and inevitability. [[Standstill]] is the centerpiece: once you establish a safe battlefield, it pressures opponents to act into your countermagic while you build resources. Win conditions like [[Mishra's Factory]] and [[Decree of Justice]] let you end the game without overcommitting.

### Early game
Focus on development and interaction. Use [[Impulse]] and [[Fact or Fiction]] to find lands and answers while keeping up [[Counterspell]] or [[Mana Leak]]. Removal like [[Swords to Plowshares]] and sweepers such as [[Wrath of God]] help stabilize, and utility lands like [[Mishra's Factory]] start to chip in once the board is clear.

### Midgame
Aim to resolve [[Standstill]] with a board that can defend itself. [[Mishra's Factory]] is excellent here because it can attack without breaking Standstill on your own turn. Use [[Disenchant]] and [[Humility]] to neutralize problematic permanents, and manage their mana with [[Dust Bowl]] when you can afford to trade resources.

### Closing the game
After you have a card advantage edge, close with manlands or a large [[Decree of Justice]]. Keep the game in a low-resource state where your draw engine and countermagic dominate. Even small advantages compound quickly in Landstill, so protect your key permanents and avoid giving your opponent a clean window to resolve a must-answer threat.
