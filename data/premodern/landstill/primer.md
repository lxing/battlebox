Use [[Standstill]] and [[manlands|Mishra's Factory]] as a powerful card advantage engine. When the coast is clear, dropping [[Standstill]] will force your opponent to pop it under pressure from your high-density creature manabase. Draw into removal, counters, and more card advantage to bury them.

### Early game
Focus on development and interaction at instant speed with [[Swords to Plowshares]], [[Impulse]], [[Counterspell]], and [[Mana Leak]]. Stabilize with [[Wrath of God]] if needed.

### Midgame
Midgame is all about card advantage and continuing instant-speed interaction. Aim to resolve [[Standstill]] on a board state you can win with manlands. Mix in [[Fact or Fiction]] whenever the opportunity presents itself.

### Endgame
After you've neutralized most of your opponent's threats, convert your sustained land drops into a kill with [[Decree of Justice]]. [[Humility]] is an excellent lock piece to embarrass creature decks.
