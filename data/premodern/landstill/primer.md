Landstill is a slow control deck that turns a stable board into a stream of cards and inevitability. [[Standstill]] is the centerpiece: once you establish a safe battlefield, it pressures opponents to pop it while you beatdown with manlands like [[Mishra's Factory]] and [[Faerie Conclave]].

### Early game
Focus on development and interaction. Use [[Impulse]] to find lands and answers while keeping up [[Counterspell]] or [[Mana Leak]]. Stabilize with [[Swords to Plowshares]] and [[Wrath of God]].

### Midgame
Midgame is all about card advantage. Aim to resolve [[Standstill]] on a board state you can win with manlands. Drop [[Fact or Fiction]] whenever the opportunity presents itself. Trade to neutralize opposing threats the entire time.

### Endgame
After you have the edge in resources, convert your sustained land drops into a kill with [[Decree of Justice]]. [[Humility]] is an excellent lock piece to embarrass creature decks.
