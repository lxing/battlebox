Elves is an explosive green creature deck that turns a wide board into huge mana bursts. [[Gaea's Cradle]] and [[Priest of Titania]] scale with each Elf you deploy, and [[Survival of the Fittest]] acts as a tutor engine that can turn extra bodies into the exact threat or utility piece you need, with [[Squee, Goblin Nabob]] as repeatable fuel. The plan can pivot between speed and toolbox play, using tempo pieces like [[Tangle Wire]] to buy time when needed.

### Early game
Lead with mana creatures like [[Llanowar Elves]] and [[Fyndhorn Elves]], then prioritize [[Quirion Ranger]] and [[Wirewood Symbiote]] to untap key mana sources and rebuy enter-the-battlefield value. Landing [[Survival of the Fittest]] early lets you start sculpting your hand. [[Multani's Acolyte]] keeps cards flowing when you need to reload.

### Midgame
Use [[Survival of the Fittest]] to chain into impact cards such as [[Deranged Hermit]] or [[Kamahl, Fist of Krosa]], or grab answers like [[Nantuko Vigilante]] at the right moment. With [[Anger]] in the graveyard, your draws shift from setup to immediate pressure. [[Tangle Wire]] is a strong tempo bridge when you are ahead on board but need time to convert mana into a finish.

### Closing the game
Close by overwhelming the board with Cradle-fueled turns, pumping with [[Kamahl, Fist of Krosa]], or generating a wide threat with [[Deranged Hermit]]. [[Masticore]] is a strong standalone threat when you have a million mana. [[Caller of the Claw]] and [[Genesis]] provide strong resilience against removal and board wipes
