Elves is an explosive green creature deck that turns a wide board into huge mana bursts. [[Gaea's Cradle]] and [[Priest of Titania]] scale with each Elf, and [[Survival of the Fittest]] is a strong tutor engine with [[Squee, Goblin Nabob]]. You can pivot effortlessly between turbo and toolbox plans.

### Early game
Lead with mana dorks like [[Llanowar Elves]] and [[Fyndhorn Elves]], then drop engine pieces [[Quirion Ranger]] and [[Wirewood Symbiote]] to untap key mana sources and rebuy enter-the-battlefield value. Cantrip with [[Multani's Acolyte]]; you can easily avoid the echo cost by chaining with [[Wirewood Symbiote]].

### Midgame
Use [[Survival of the Fittest]] to chain into [[Squee|Squee, Goblin Nabob]] and impact cards such as [[Deranged Hermit]] and [[Masticore]]. If needed, grab answers like [[Nantuko Vigilante]] or [[Wellwisher]]. [[Tangle Wire]] is a strong tempo bridge when you are ahead on board but need time to convert that into a finish.

### Endgame
Close by overwhelming the board with [[Gaea's Cradle]] and [[Priest of Titania]]-fueled turns, delivering a fast kill with some combination [[Anger]], [[Kamahl|Kamahl, Fist of Krosa]], and an army of Elves/Squirrels. [[Masticore]] is a board nuke when you have a million mana. [[Caller of the Claw]] and [[Genesis]] provide strong resilience against removal and board wipes.
