Vomit out Elves and channel a wide board into huge mana bursts. [[Gaea's Cradle]] and [[Priest of Titania]] scale with each Elf, and [[Survival of the Fittest]] is a strong tutor engine with [[Squee, Goblin Nabob]]. You can pivot effortlessly between turbo and toolbox plans.

### Early game
Lead with mana dorks like [[Llanowar Elves]] and [[Fyndhorn Elves]], then drop engine pieces [[Quirion Ranger]] and [[Wirewood Symbiote]] to untap key mana sources and rebuy ETB value. Start a card advantage engine by chaining [[Multani's Acolyte]] with [[Wirewood Symbiote]].

### Midgame
Use [[Survival of the Fittest]] to pull out [[Squee|Squee, Goblin Nabob]] and high-impact cards such as [[Deranged Hermit]] and [[Masticore]]. If needed, grab answers like [[Nantuko Vigilante]] or [[Wellwisher]]. [[Tangle Wire]] is a strong tempo play when you're ahead on board and need to finish before a sweeper or combo kill.

### Endgame
Overwhelm the board with [[Gaea's Cradle]] and [[Priest of Titania]]-fueled bong rips, delivering an instant kill with some combination [[Anger]], [[Kamahl|Kamahl, Fist of Krosa]], and an army of Elves/Squirrels. [[Masticore]] is a board nuke when you have unlimited mana. Use [[Caller of the Claw]] and [[Genesis]] to resist board wipes.

You also have the hilarious [[Masticore]]/[[Goblin Sharpshooter]] and [[Kamahl|Kamahl, Fist of Krosa]] land destruction combo if wiping down small creatures alone wasn't enough.
