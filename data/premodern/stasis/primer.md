Lock opponents under [[Stasis]] while generating enough free mana with tricks like [[Gush]] and [[Forsaken City]] to keep the namesake enchantment alive. Then win slowly with [[Black Vise]]. Careful sequencing and resource management are critical.

### Early game
Stabilize and set up. Use [[Chain of Vapor]] and [[Arcane Denial]] to buy time while you assemble the lock pieces and dig for [[Stasis]]

### Midgame
Resolve [[Stasis]] when you have enough resources to continuously maintain it. [[Forsaken City]] is the key engine here, and [[Gush]] helps you keep the lock going while refilling your hand. Use soft permission like [[Daze]] and [[Thwart]] to protect the lock without needing to tap out; these also serve double duty resetting your lands.

### Endgame
Keep the lock stable and land a [[Black Vise]] chip the opponent to death.
