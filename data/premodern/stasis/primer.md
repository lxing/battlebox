Stasis is a prison-control deck that locks opponents under [[Stasis]] while generating enough untap resources to keep the lock alive. The deck combines cheap interaction with mana tricks like [[Gush]] and [[Forsaken City]], then wins slowly with [[Black Vise]] and incremental damage. It rewards careful sequencing and resource management.

### Early game
Stabilize and set up. Use [[Chain of Vapor]] and countermagic like [[Arcane Denial]] to buy time while you assemble the lock pieces. [[Black Vise]] is a strong early play that pressures opponents who are forced to hold cards under Stasis. Try to keep your land drops flexible and conserve mana where possible.

### Midgame
Resolve [[Stasis]] when you can maintain it. [[Forsaken City]] is the key engine, and [[Gush]] helps you keep the lock going while refilling your hand. Use soft permission like [[Daze]] and [[Thwart]] to protect the lock without needing to tap out.

### Closing the game
Once Stasis is established, the opponent is largely frozen out. Keep the lock stable and let [[Black Vise]] chip away, or win through a slow attrition line. Your goal is to deny meaningful untaps while always having a plan to pay for or reset [[Stasis]] on your terms.
