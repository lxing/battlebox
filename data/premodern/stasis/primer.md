Stasis is a prison-control deck that locks opponents under [[Stasis]] while generating enough free mana with tricks like [[Gush]] and [[Forsaken City]] to keep the lock alive. It then wins slowly with [[Black Vise]]. Careful sequencing and resource management are critical.

### Early game
Stabilize and set up. Use [[Chain of Vapor]] and [[Arcane Denial]] to buy time while you assemble the lock pieces.

### Midgame
Resolve [[Stasis]] when you can maintain it. [[Forsaken City]] is the key engine, and [[Gush]] helps you keep the lock going while refilling your hand. Use soft permission like [[Daze]] and [[Thwart]] to protect the lock without needing to tap out; these also serve double duty resetting your lands.

### Endgame
Once [[Stasis]] is established, the opponent is largely frozen out. Keep the lock stable and let [[Black Vise]] chip them to death.
