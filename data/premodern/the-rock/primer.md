The Rock is a black‑green midrange deck built on disruption, removal, and resilient threats. It opens with hand disruption like [[Duress]] and [[Cabal Therapy]], then stabilizes with efficient blockers and sweepers such as [[Pernicious Deed]]. The deck wins by grinding down resources and sticking highly efficient and well-costed threats.

### Early game
Accelerate with [[Birds of Paradise]] and [[Yavimaya Elder]] while defending with [[Wall of Blossoms]]. Use early removal and discard to trade efficiently.

### Midgame
This is where The Rock dominates. [[Pernicious Deed]] will stabilize any large boards, and [[Living Wish]] lets you branch into inevitability with [[Genesis]], removal with [[Bone Shredder]], or pure combat with [[Spiritmonger]]. [[Blastoderm]] is a fast clock that can close games out of nowhere. Continue to sprinkle in disruption as needed with your varied removal/discard suite and oneoff [[Dust Bowl]]. 

### Endgame
Finish with a nonstop stream of threats and manlands. [[Recurring Nightmare]] is an excellent endgame and chains well with [[Wall of Blossoms]], [[Living Wish]] targets, and general fatties.
