The Rock is a black‑green midrange deck built on disruption, removal, and resilient threats. It opens with hand disruption like [[Duress]] and [[Cabal Therapy]], then stabilizes with efficient blockers and sweepers such as [[Pernicious Deed]]. The deck wins by grinding down resources and sticking hard‑to‑answer threats like [[Ravenous Baloth]] or [[Treetop Village]].

### Early game
Lead with discard to break up opposing plans and protect your curve. [[Birds of Paradise]] accelerates you into key spells, while [[Wall of Blossoms]] keeps cards flowing. Use early removal to trade efficiently and set up a favorable midgame.

### Midgame
This is where The Rock dominates. [[Pernicious Deed]] resets the board when needed, and [[Living Wish]] gives you flexible access to silver‑bullet creatures. [[Blastoderm]] provides a fast clock that can close games before opponents recover. Manage your resources carefully so you can keep presenting threats while holding answers.

### Closing the game
Finish with a steady stream of threats and manlands. [[Ravenous Baloth]] stabilizes life totals, and [[Treetop Village]] keeps pressure on even through sweepers. The deck wins by staying ahead on cards and forcing opponents into inefficient trades until they run out of answers.
