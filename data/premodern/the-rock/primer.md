Play the iconic midrange experience built around disruption, removal, and super efficient threats. Every card in the deck accelerates, trades down your opponent's resources, or outmuscles and outvalues equivalently-costed creatures.

### Early game
Accelerate with [[Birds of Paradise]] and [[Yavimaya Elder]] while defending with [[Wall of Blossoms]]. Trade judiciously with removal and discard.

### Midgame
The Rock's time to shine. [[Pernicious Deed]] will stabilize any large boards, and [[Living Wish]] lets you branch into inevitability with [[Genesis]], removal with [[Bone Shredder]], or pure combat with [[Spiritmonger]]. [[Blastoderm]] and [[Ravenous Baloth]] are fast clocks that can close games out of nowhere. Continue to sprinkle in disruption as needed.

### Endgame
Finish with a nonstop stream of threats and manlands. [[Recurring Nightmare]] is an excellent endgame and chains well with [[Wall of Blossoms]], [[Living Wish]] targets, and general fatties. Your top end is dedicated to the impressive [[Spiritmonger]].
