Open a massive toolbox with [[Survival of the Fittest]]. Convert [[Recurring Nightmare]] into an endless value loop of repeated ETB effects. With a mix of mana creatures, disruption, and grindy threats, the deck excels at inevitability, but falls flat at speed.

### Early game
Develop your mana with [[Birds of Paradise]] and stabilize with defensive bodies like [[Wall of Blossoms]], [[Wall of Roots]], and [[Ravenous Baloth]]. [[Cabal Therapy]] provides early disruption and scales well with token and Echo creatures later.

### Midgame
Use [[Survival of the Fittest]] into [[Squee, Goblin Nabob]] and [[Genesis]] to setup the endless value engine. Silver bullets like [[Bone Shredder]], [[Ghitu Slinger]], [[Shard Phoenix]], and [[Masticore]] let you liquidate all sorts of board states. Ride the value train of [[Deranged Hermit]], [[Yavimaya Elder]], and [[Yavimaya Granger]] to build your board state while digging for [[Recurring Nightmare]].

### Endgame
A big fatty like [[Phantom Nishoba]] ends game against aggro. Otherwise, recursion loops give you the grindiest endgame out of the entire battlebox; for instance [[Deranged Hermit]] and [[Recurring Nightmare]] create three fresh Squirrels per turn. You may also go for an infinite combo finish: [[Great Whale]] with [[Recurring Nightmare]] and another creature will generate infinite mana and ETB triggers, which you can then convert into infinite life with [[Spike Feeder]], infinite Squirrels with [[Deranged Hermit]], infinite pings with [[Masticore]]...the list goes on. The only thing that can stop you is graveyard hate.
