RecSur is a resilient midrange deck built around recursive value engines. [[Survival of the Fittest]] lets you turn any creature into the best card for the situation, while [[Recurring Nightmare]] converts that tutoring into repeated enters-the-battlefield effects. With a mix of mana creatures, disruption, and grindy threats, the deck excels at turning small advantages into inevitability.

### Early game
Develop your mana with [[Birds of Paradise]] and stabilize with defensive bodies like [[Wall of Blossoms]] and [[Wall of Roots]]. [[Cabal Therapy]] provides early disruption and scales well with creature tokens later. If you can land [[Survival of the Fittest]] early, you can start chaining into the exact mix of threats and answers you need.

### Midgame
Use [[Survival of the Fittest]] plus recursion to take control. [[Squee, Goblin Nabob]] and [[Genesis]] keep the engine running, while silver bullets like [[Bone Shredder]] and [[Ghitu Slinger]] let you answer specific boards. Big-value creatures such as [[Deranged Hermit]] or [[Ravenous Baloth]] help you stabilize, and [[Recurring Nightmare]] turns every creature into repeatable advantage.

### Closing the game
Close by overwhelming the board with recurring threats. [[Recurring Nightmare]] loops let you grind out removal, and a steady stream of bodies from [[Deranged Hermit]] or a large [[Phantom Nishoba]] can end the game quickly once you are ahead. Keep mana open to protect the engine and avoid overextending into sweepers.
