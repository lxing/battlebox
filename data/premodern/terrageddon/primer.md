TerraGeddon is a green‑white midrange deck that combines efficient threats with mana denial. It leverages [[Mox Diamond]], [[Wasteland]], and [[Armageddon]] to keep opponents off their spells while attacking with creatures that grow in tandem with land destruction. [[Terravore]] and [[Nimble Mongoose]] are the primary win conditions.

### Early game
Develop mana quickly and look for land denial lines. [[Mox Diamond]] accelerates you into early pressure or a quick [[Armageddon]] setup. [[Weathered Wayfarer]] helps you hit every land drop while also chaining repeated [[Wasteland]]. Use [[Swords to Plowshares]] to stabilize.

### Midgame
When you have board advantage and/or [[Mox Diamond]], drop [[Armageddon]]. Absent that, [[Terravore]] and [[Exalted Angel]] make a great midrange plan. [[Sylvan Library]] is a strong card advantage engine, especially with the Angel..

### Endgame
The endgame plan is essentially unchanged from midgame. [[Armageddon]] is just that good.
