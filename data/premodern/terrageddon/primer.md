Combine efficient threats with mana denial, albeit not quite as toxic as the Oath deck. [[Mox Diamond]], [[Wasteland]], and [[Armageddon]] keep your opponents permanently behind. [[Terravore]] and [[Nimble Mongoose]] are the primary win conditions.

### Early game
Develop mana quickly and look for land denial lines. [[Mox Diamond]] accelerates you into early pressure or a quick [[Armageddon]] setup. [[Weathered Wayfarer]] helps you hit every land drop while also chaining repeated [[Wasteland]]. Use [[Swords to Plowshares]] to stabilize.

### Midgame
When you have board advantage, [[Mox Diamond]], and/or a few sandbagged lands, drop [[Armageddon]] without hesitation. Even without it, [[Terravore]] and [[Exalted Angel]] make a great midrange plan. [[Sylvan Library]] is a strong card advantage engine that interacts well with the Angel.

### Endgame
Essentially unchanged from midgame. [[Armageddon]] is just that good.
