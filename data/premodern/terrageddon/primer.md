TerraGeddon is a green‑white tempo deck that combines efficient threats with mana denial. It leverages [[Mox Diamond]], [[Wasteland]], and [[Armageddon]] to keep opponents off balance while attacking with creatures that grow with the battlefield. [[Terravore]] and [[Nimble Mongoose]] are the primary win conditions, and [[Sylvan Library]] helps you keep pressure and disruption flowing.

### Early game
Develop mana quickly and look for land denial lines. [[Mox Diamond]] accelerates you into early pressure or a quick [[Armageddon]] setup. Deploy a threat like [[Nimble Mongoose]] and start attacking while you use [[Wasteland]] and [[Weathered Wayfarer]] to constrain their mana.

### Midgame
Aim to land [[Armageddon]] when you have a threat on board and can recover faster than the opponent. [[Terravore]] grows rapidly as lands hit the graveyard, and [[Sylvan Library]] helps you find more disruption or a second threat. Use [[Swords to Plowshares]] to remove blockers and keep the clock going.

### Closing the game
Close by riding a large [[Terravore]] or an unanswered Mongoose to the finish while your opponent struggles to rebuild. The deck wins by turning mana denial into time, then converting that time into lethal attacks. Be deliberate about when to fire off [[Armageddon]]—it is often the decisive swing if you are ahead on board.
