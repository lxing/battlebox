Goblins is a fast, disruptive tribal deck that combines explosive starts with steady card advantage. [[Goblin Lackey]] creates the most threatening openings, while [[Goblin Matron]] and [[Goblin Ringleader]] keep the deck stocked with action. [[Goblin Warchief]] turns on haste and cost reduction, making the deck’s midgame swings especially punishing.

### Early game
Look for pressure plus a way to sustain it. A turn-one [[Goblin Lackey]] or [[Mogg Fanatic]] forces early interaction, and [[Goblin Warchief]] accelerates your curve into the key three- and four-drops. If you have it, [[Rishadan Port]] can constrain opposing mana and open a window for a big attack.

### Midgame
This is where the deck’s tutoring and refuel engines take over. [[Goblin Matron]] finds the right tool for the board, and [[Goblin Ringleader]] often refills your hand. [[Gempalm Incinerator]] handles blockers efficiently, and [[Goblin Sharpshooter]] can dominate creature boards. Use [[Wasteland]] and [[Rishadan Port]] to keep opponents off balance while you keep applying pressure.

### Closing the game
Close with burst damage from [[Goblin Piledriver]] and hasty teams enabled by [[Goblin Warchief]]. [[Siege-Gang Commander]] provides reach and inevitability by turning extra goblins into direct damage. [[Goblin King]] gives a final push when you need to break through a stalled battlefield.
