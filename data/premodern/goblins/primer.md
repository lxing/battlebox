Goblins is a fast, disruptive tribal deck that combines explosive starts with steady card advantage. [[Goblin Lackey]] creates the most threatening openings, while [[Goblin Matron]] and [[Goblin Ringleader]] keep the deck stocked with action. [[Goblin Warchief]] turns on haste and cost reduction, making the deck’s midgame swings especially punishing.

### Early game
Look for pressure plus a way to sustain it. Turn one [[Goblin Lackey]] forces early interaction, and a second-wave [[Goblin Warchief]] accelerates your curve into the key three- and four-drops. [[Rishadan Port]] is very flexible and can either buy you time into the midgame or create a brutal asymmetry with [[Goblin Lackey]].

### Midgame
This is where the deck’s tutoring and refuel engines take over. Spam [[Goblin Matron]] and [[Goblin Ringleader]]. Use [[Gempalm Incinerator]] and [[Goblin Sharpshooter]] to dominate creature boards. An unchecked [[Goblin Piledriver]] with moderate goblin support can rampage here.

### Endgame
[[Siege-Gang Commander]] provides reach and inevitability by turning extra goblins into direct damage. [[Goblin King]] will wreck any red deck. Lastly, [[Goblin Sharpshooter]] and [[Skirk Prospector]] can kill out of nowhere.
