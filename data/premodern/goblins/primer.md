Combine explosive starts with a relentless swarm of Golblins. [[Goblin Lackey]] and [[Goblin Warchief]] accelerate your development for [[Goblin Matron]] and [[Goblin Ringleader]] to grind out a steady stream of threats. Numerous late game options give you the option of playing for combo or combat lines.

### Early game
Look for early pressure. The dream is turn-one [[Goblin Lackey]] with maybe a [[Mogg Fanatic]] to clear out blockers, with [[Goblin Warchief]] as backup plan to accelerate into the heavy part of your curve. [[Rishadan Port]] is very flexible and can either buy time to bridge into the midgame or create a strong asymmetry with [[Goblin Lackey]].

### Midgame
Let the deck’s tutoring and refuel engines take over. Spam [[Goblin Matron]] and [[Goblin Ringleader]]. Use [[Gempalm Incinerator]] and [[Goblin Sharpshooter]] to attack creature-heavy boards. An unchecked [[Goblin Piledriver]] with moderate goblin support can kill quickly here.

### Endgame
Dig for [[Siege-Gang Commander]] to provide reach and inevitability, turning extra goblins into direct damage. [[Goblin King]] will wreck any red opponent. [[Goblin Sharpshooter]] and [[Skirk Prospector]] provide a combo flourish to your otherwise aggressive game plan.
