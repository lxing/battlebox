Oath is a mana-denial control deck that leverages [[Oath of Druids]] as a fast win condition. The deck goes straight for the throat with [[Thermokarst]], [[Winter's Grasp]], [[Wasteland]], and [[Rishadan Port]], then uses [[Oath of Druids]] to cheat a large [[Terravore]] into play. [[Mox Diamond]] and [[Sphere of Resistance]] break mana parity even further.

### Early game
Prioritize acceleration and disruption. A start with [[Mox Diamond]] into land destruction is golden. Use [[Swords to Plowshares]] to answer early threats.

### Midgame
Land an [[Oath of Druids]] to take over the board. Start spamming mana denial to completely shut down your opponent's game plan. Accumulate cards with [[Sylvan Library]] so you can continue trading one-for-one and pull ahead.

### Closing the game
Use [[Terravore]] to beat your opponent to death. If the board clogs, [[Mishra's Factory]] and [[Treetop Village]] provide additional bodies without turning off Oath.
