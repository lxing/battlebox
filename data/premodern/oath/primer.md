Combine warcrimes-level mana denial with incredible creature hate. Go straight for the throat with [[Thermokarst]], [[Winter's Grasp]], [[Wasteland]], and [[Rishadan Port]], then use [[Oath of Druids]] to cheat an enormous [[Terravore]] into play. [[Mox Diamond]] and [[Sphere of Resistance]] break mana parity even further.

### Early game
Prioritize acceleration and disruption. A start with [[Mox Diamond]] into land destruction is golden. Use [[Swords to Plowshares]] to suppress early threats.

### Midgame
Land an [[Oath of Druids]] and stabilize against creature decks with [[Terravore]]. Keep spamming mana denial to completely shut down your opponent's game plan. Use [[Sylvan Library]] so you can continue trading one-for-one and pull ahead.

### Endgame
Keep using fetchlands, Moxes, and Oath activations to grow [[Terravore]] and beat your opponent to death. If the board clogs, [[Mishra's Factory]] and [[Treetop Village]] provide additional bodies without turning off Oath.
