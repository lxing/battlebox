Oath is a mana-denial control deck that leverages [[Oath of Druids]] as a fast win condition. The deck constrains opposing development with [[Rishadan Port]], [[Wasteland]], and land destruction like [[Thermokarst]] and [[Winter's Grasp]], then uses [[Oath of Druids]] to cheat a large [[Terravore]] into play. [[Mox Diamond]] and [[Sphere of Resistance]] help you pull ahead in the early turns by breaking parity on mana.

### Early game
Prioritize acceleration and disruption. A start with [[Mox Diamond]] into [[Sphere of Resistance]] or a land-destruction spell can slow the opponent enough to set up. Keep creature counts low so [[Oath of Druids]] is live, and use [[Swords to Plowshares]] to answer early threats while you establish your mana denial plan.

### Midgame
Once [[Oath of Druids]] is active, focus on maintaining control of the board and mana. Your land-denial suite makes it hard for the opponent to rebuild, and each destroyed land grows [[Terravore]] into a quickly lethal threat. [[Sylvan Library]] keeps the cards flowing so you can continue trading one-for-one while Oath and manlands apply pressure.

### Closing the game
Close by protecting a large [[Terravore]] and attacking while the opponent is constrained on mana. If the board clogs, [[Mishra's Factory]] and [[Treetop Village]] provide additional threats without turning off Oath. Be mindful of when to play your own creatures so you don’t disable Oath before you are ready to win.
