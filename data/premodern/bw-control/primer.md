BW Control is a classic old-school control deck: few threats, lots of efficient interaction, and a wide spread of answers. The plan is to neutralize the opponent’s game plan, stretch the game, and win late with resilient finishers like [[Exalted Angel]] and [[Eternal Dragon]].

## Early game
Use [[Duress]] and [[Gerrard's Verdict]] to strip key spells and slow the opponent’s development. Back that up with flexible removal like [[Swords to Plowshares]] and [[Vindicate]] to keep the board clear while you trade resources.

## Midgame
[[Wrath of God]] resets the board when you fall behind, and [[Skeletal Scrying]] provides burst card advantage at instant speed. [[Phyrexian Furnace]] gives targeted graveyard interaction and can recycle itself when it is no longer relevant. [[Eternal Dragon]] helps ensure land drops early and returns later as a long-game threat.

## Closing the game
[[Exalted Angel]] stabilizes against aggressive decks and turns races around. [[Decree of Justice]] is your most flexible finisher; the cycling mode is often the safer line and plays well through counter-heavy matchups, while hard-casting can close quickly when the coast is clear.

## Sideboard overview
[[Circle of Protection: Red]] and [[Warmth]] are the primary tools against red damage. [[Aura of Silence]] and extra [[Disenchant]] cover artifacts and enchantments. [[Infest]] helps against go-wide creature decks, and [[Haunting Echoes]] plus [[Tormod's Crypt]] reinforce the graveyard plan. [[Engineered Plague]] and [[Silver Knight]] are additional matchup-specific tools.
