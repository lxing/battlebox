BW Control is a classic old-school control deck: few threats, lots of efficient interaction, and a wide spread of answers. The plan is to neutralize the opponent’s game plan, stretch the game, and win late with resilient finishers like [[Exalted Angel]] and [[Eternal Dragon]].

### Early game
Use [[Duress]] and [[Gerrard's Verdict]] to strip key spells and slow the opponent’s development. Back that up with flexible removal like [[Swords to Plowshares]] and [[Vindicate]] to keep the board clear while you trade resources.

### Midgame
Use [[Wrath of God]] to reset the board when you fall behind, and [[Skeletal Scrying]] for burst card advantage at instant speed. Use [[Exalted Angel]] to stabilize against aggressive decks and as a hefty midgame threat. [[Eternal Dragon]] helps ensure land drops early and returns later as a long-game threat.

### Closing the game
[[Decree of Justice]] is your most flexible finisher; the cycling mode is often the safer line and plays well through counter-heavy matchups, while hard-casting can close quickly when the coast is clear. [[Eternal Dragon]] will give you very slow but powerful inevitability.
