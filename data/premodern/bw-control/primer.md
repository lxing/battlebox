A classic old-school control deck with lots of removal and discard, solid card advantage, and a few versatile finishers.

### Early game
Use [[Duress]] and [[Gerrard's Verdict]] to strip key spells and slow the opponent’s development. Back it up with flexible removal in [[Swords to Plowshares]] and [[Vindicate]]. Aggressively trade resources. Use [[Wrath of God]] to reset the board if you fall behind.

### Midgame
Setup a big [[Skeletal Scrying]] for burst card advantage. [[Exalted Angel]] will stabilize against aggressive decks hoping to burn you out, and also fuels the Scrying. Use [[Eternal Dragon]] liberally to hit every land drop. If your opponent shows any hint of weakness, you have the option to go for mana denial with [[Vindicate]] and [[Dust Bowl]] on their lands, but be cautious of them catching back up if you don't have way to close them out.

### Endgame
[[Decree of Justice]] is your most flexible finisher, the cycling mode is often the safer line and plays well through counter-heavy matchups. [[Eternal Dragon]] provides very slow but powerful inevitability once you have a million lands.
