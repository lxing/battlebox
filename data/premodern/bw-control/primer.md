BW Control is a classic old-school control deck: lots of efficient interaction, some potent card advantage, and a few threats. Neutralize the opponent’s game plan, stretch the game, and win late with versatile finishers like [[Exalted Angel]] and [[Eternal Dragon]].

### Early game
Use [[Duress]] and [[Gerrard's Verdict]] to strip key spells and slow the opponent’s development. Back that up with flexible removal like [[Swords to Plowshares]] and [[Vindicate]] to keep the board clear. Aggressively trade resources. Use [[Wrath of God]] to reset the board if you fall behind.

### Midgame
Setup a big [[Skeletal Scrying]] for burst card advantage. [[Exalted Angel]] will stabilize against aggressive decks hoping to burn you out, and also fuels the Scrying. Use [[Eternal Dragon]] freely to hit every land drop. If your opponent shows any hint of weakness, you have the option to lean into mana denial with [[Vindicate]] and [[Dust Bowl]] on their lands.

### Endgame
[[Decree of Justice]] is your most flexible finisher; the cycling mode is often the safer line and plays well through counter-heavy matchups, while hard-casting can close quickly when the coast is clear. [[Eternal Dragon]] will give you very slow but powerful inevitability once you have a dozen lands.
