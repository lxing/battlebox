Stiflenought is a blue tempo deck built around the [[Phyrexian Dreadnought]] combo. By casting the Dreadnought and countering its trigger with [[Stifle]] or [[Vision Charm]], the deck creates a huge threat far ahead of curve. Backed by efficient cantrips and countermagic, it plays a disruptive game with a fast clock.

### Early game
Sculpt your hand and dig for [[Phyrexian Dreadnought]] with [[Portent]], [[Opt]], and [[Impulse]] while keeping interaction up with [[Counterspell]] or [[Daze]]. If you know you can safely resolve the combo early against a deck without answers, just go for it. 

### Midgame
Play a patient tempo game and wait for a window where your combo lines up with protection. Once a Dreadnought is on board, switch to protection mode. Use [[Gush]] to grab a lot of cards on your very low curve, and [[Foil]] to protect your Dreadnought even when tapped out. [[Stifle]] can also hit opposing fetches if you are cheeky enough to take the mana denial route.

### Endgame
The gameplan begins and ends with [[Phyrexian Dreadnought]]. If they answer the first threat, the deck has enough card selection to assemble a second, but accept that outcome only as a last resort. Postboard, [[Parallax Tide]] and [[Stifle]] completely wreck slow decks.
