Stiflenought is a blue tempo deck built around the [[Phyrexian Dreadnought]] combo. By casting the Dreadnought and countering its drawback with [[Stifle]] or [[Vision Charm]], the deck creates a huge threat far ahead of curve. Backed by efficient cantrips and countermagic, it plays a disruptive game with a fast clock.

### Early game
Set up your hand with [[Portent]] and [[Impulse]] while keeping mana open for [[Counterspell]] or [[Daze]]. If you can safely resolve the combo early, it often forces immediate answers. Otherwise, play a patient tempo game and wait for a window where your protection lines up.

### Midgame
Once a Dreadnought is on board, switch to protection mode. Use [[Gush]] and [[Foil]] to keep countermagic up while still developing. [[Stifle]] can also hit opposing fetches or triggered abilities, buying time when you need to stabilize.

### Closing the game
A single Dreadnought ends the game quickly. Keep your opponent off balance with counters and bounce, and avoid overextending into removal. If they answer the first threat, the deck has enough card selection to assemble a second, so prioritize clean lines that keep interaction available.
