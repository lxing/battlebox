Play a tempo game built around the [[Phyrexian Dreadnought]] combo. By casting the Dreadnought and neutralizing its trigger with [[Stifle]] or [[Vision Charm]], you get a huge threat far ahead of curve. Protect it and swing twice to win.

### Early game
Sculpt your hand and dig for [[Phyrexian Dreadnought]] with [[Portent]], [[Opt]], and [[Impulse]] while keeping interaction up with [[Counterspell]] or [[Daze]]. If you know you can safely resolve the combo early against a deck without answers, just go for it. 

### Midgame
Play a patient tempo game and wait for a window where your combo lines up with protection. Once a Dreadnought is on board, switch to protection mode. Use [[Gush]] aggressively to grab cards on your very low curve, and [[Foil]] to protect your Dreadnought even when tapped out.

### Endgame
The gameplan begins and ends with [[Phyrexian Dreadnought]]. If they answer the first threat, the deck has enough card selection to assemble a second, but try to avoid that outcome. Postboard, [[Parallax Tide]] and [[Stifle]] completely wreck slow decks.
