Replenish is a combo-control deck that fills the graveyard with enchantments, then brings them all back at once for a devastating swing. [[Attunement]] and [[Frantic Search]] load the graveyard while keeping your hand stocked, and [[Replenish]] returns key pieces such as [[Opalescence]], [[Parallax Tide]], and [[Parallax Wave]]. Fast mana from [[Ancient Tomb]] and [[City of Traitors]] lets you set up quickly while still holding up interaction.

### Early game
Use cantrips and looters to sculpt your hand and set up the graveyard. [[Attunement]] is the most efficient way to discard enchantments while drawing fresh cards. Protect yourself with [[Mana Leak]] or [[Swords to Plowshares]] as you assemble the Replenish turn, and use your mana acceleration to stay ahead on tempo.

### Midgame
Look for a window to resolve [[Replenish]] with impact. [[Opalescence]] plus [[Parallax Wave]] or [[Parallax Tide]] can lock down the board and clear blockers. [[Intuition]] often finds the right mix of pieces and redundancy, especially when you already have a discard outlet.

### Closing the game
Once your enchantments return, the game usually ends quickly. Animated permanents from [[Opalescence]] provide a fast clock, and the Parallax enchantments can remove their remaining defenses. Continue to use countermagic to protect the board and avoid giving the opponent a clean answer to your engine.
