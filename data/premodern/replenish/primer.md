Setup quickly with fast mana, fill the graveyard with enchantments, then bring them all back at once with the namesake [[Replenish]] for a devastating swing. Key pieces such as [[Opalescence]], [[Parallax Tide]], and [[Parallax Wave]] convert the critical combo turn into complete board dominance.

### Early game
Use cantrips and loot effects to sculpt your hand and set up the graveyard. [[Attunement]] is the most efficient way to discard enchantments while drawing fresh cards. Protect yourself with [[Mana Leak]] or [[Swords to Plowshares]].

### Midgame
Dig hard for [[Replenish]] and try to resolve it with a stocked graveyard. [[Intuition]] can be used flexibly to tutor up three copies of [[Replenish]] or three value enchantments.

Even without reanimation, [[Parallax Wave]] and [[Parallax Tide]] combo with [[Seal of Cleansing]] for very nasty board state manipulation. With multiple exile triggers on the stack, destroy them with [[Seal of Cleansing]], which triggers the exit clause. Stack resolution causes the exit clause to resolve first, then you remove all their lands and creatures permanantly...and then do it all over again later with [[Replenish]]! 

### Endgame
Once you pop the combo, the game ends quickly. [[Opalescence]] provides a really fast clock, in tandem with the Parallax enchantments obliterating their board state.
