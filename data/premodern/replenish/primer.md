Replenish is a combo-control deck that fills the graveyard with enchantments, then brings them all back at once with the namesake [[Replenish]] for a devastating swing. [[Attunement]] and [[Frantic Search]] load the graveyard while keeping your hand stocked, and key pieces such as [[Opalescence]], [[Parallax Tide]], and [[Parallax Wave]] convert the critical turn into complete board dominance. Fast mana from [[Ancient Tomb]] and [[City of Traitors]] lets you setup incredibly quickly.

### Early game
Use cantrips and looters to sculpt your hand and set up the graveyard. [[Attunement]] is the most efficient way to discard enchantments while drawing fresh cards. Protect yourself with [[Mana Leak]] or [[Swords to Plowshares]].

### Midgame
Dig hard for [[Replenish]] and try to resolve it with a stocked graveyard. [[Intuition]] can be used to tutor up three copies of [[Replenish]] or three value enchantments, it's not hard to setup a terrible choice.

Even without reanimation, [[Parallax Wave]] and [[Parallax Tide]] combo with [[Seal of Cleansing]] for very nasty board state manipulation. With the enters trigger on the stack, destroy them with [[Seal of Cleansing]], which triggers the exit clause. Stack resolution causes the exit clause to resolve first, then you remove all their lands and creatures permanantly...then you can do it all over again later with [[Replenish]]! 

### Closing the game
Once you pop the combo, the game usually ends quickly. [[Opalescence]] provides a really fast clock, in tandem with the Parallax enchantments obliterating their board state.
