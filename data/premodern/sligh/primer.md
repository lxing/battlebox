Sligh is a classic red aggro deck that pressures life totals from the first turn and finishes with reach. Cheap threats like [[Jackal Pup]] and [[Mogg Fanatic]] set the pace, while burn spells such as [[Lightning Bolt]] and [[Incinerate]] let you convert early damage into a quick finish. [[Grim Lavamancer]], [[Sulfuric Vortex]], and [[Cursed Scroll]] give the deck surprising staying power.

### Early game
Curve out with one-drops and start attacking immediately. [[Jackal Pup]] and [[Mogg Fanatic]] are ideal openers. Mulligan hard for a good curve.

### Midgame
Get in with your heavy hitter [[Ball Lightning]]. With a million burn spells, you'll have to exercise judgment on clearing blockers to get through damage, disrupting your opponent's creatures, or just going to the face. The right choice is going to the face a lot more often than you would expect. Use [[Bloodstained Mire]] and [[Wooded Foothills]] to thin and fuel Lavamancer.

### Endgame
The repeatable engines [[Grim Lavamancer]], [[Sulfuric Vortex]], and [[Cursed Scroll]] provide quite a bit of inevitability if your opponent is low enough. Finish them with a big burst from [[Fireblast]] and [[Price of Progress]].
