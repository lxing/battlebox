Sligh is a classic red aggro deck that pressures life totals from the first turn and finishes with reach. Cheap threats like [[Jackal Pup]] and [[Mogg Fanatic]] set the pace, while burn spells such as [[Lightning Bolt]] and [[Incinerate]] let you convert early damage into a quick finish. [[Grim Lavamancer]] and [[Fireblast]] give the deck staying power when the game goes long.

### Early game
Curve out with one-drops and start attacking immediately. [[Jackal Pup]] and [[Mogg Fanatic]] are ideal openers, and [[Grim Lavamancer]] turns your spells into repeatable damage. Use burn to clear blockers rather than to go upstairs if it keeps your attacks flowing.

### Midgame
As hands empty, prioritize damage efficiency. [[Ball Lightning]] and [[Fireblast]] can swing races in a single turn, and [[Seal of Fire]] lets you bank damage while keeping mana open. Use [[Bloodstained Mire]] and [[Wooded Foothills]] to thin and fuel Lavamancer when you need extra reach.

### Closing the game
Close with burst damage and direct burn. Sequencing matters: try to force blocks and then finish with [[Fireblast]] or a double-spell turn. The deck wins by squeezing every point of damage from its early creatures while preserving just enough burn to finish the last few life points.
